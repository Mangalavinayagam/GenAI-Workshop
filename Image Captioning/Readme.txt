Title:
Image Captioning with Vision-Language Models

Project Description:
This notebook implements an Image Captioning project. The goal is to generate descriptive captions for input images using a combination of computer vision and natural language processing techniques. It preprocesses images using a pre-trained CNN (e.g., VGG16) and likely integrates these features with an LSTM-based language model to generate captions.

Approach:
Image Preprocessing:

Utilizes a pre-trained CNN (e.g., VGG16) to extract features from input images.
Resizes and preprocesses images to fit the CNN input requirements.
Caption Generation:

Implements a language model using LSTM layers to generate captions based on image features and text embeddings.
Likely integrates the extracted image features with sequential text inputs to train a combined model.
Model Parameters:

Includes settings for maximum caption length and other configurable hyperparameters.

Metrics:
BLEU Score: Measures the similarity between generated captions and reference captions.
CIDEr: Evaluates the relevance and descriptive power of the captions.
ROUGE and METEOR: Assess the overlap of phrases and semantic similarity.
