Title:
Summarization System with T5

Project Description:
This notebook implements Text Summarization using the T5 model (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer). The objective is to generate concise and coherent summaries from longer pieces of text, leveraging T5's ability to handle summarization as a sequence-to-sequence learning problem.

Approach:
Environment Setup:

Installs the transformers library to access pre-trained models like T5 and torch for tensor computations.
Model and Tokenizer Initialization:

Loads the "t5-large" model and its corresponding tokenizer for processing text and generating summaries.
Summarization Function:

Prepares input text prefixed with the task keyword "summarize."
Tokenizes the input and feeds it to the T5 model to generate summaries.
Decodes the generated token IDs back into human-readable text.
File Input:

Reads text data from a file (Script.txt) and generates a summary for the content.

Metrics:
ROUGE Score: Measures the overlap between generated and reference summaries.
BLEU Score: Assesses the similarity to human-generated summaries.
Compression Ratio: Evaluates the conciseness of the summary relative to the original text.
