Title:
Text-to-Speech System Using Quantized Models

Project Description:
This notebook demonstrates a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system using the Tacotron2 model. The implementation focuses on generating synthetic speech from text input. Additionally, it applies quantization techniques to optimize the model for efficient inference.

Approach:
Environment Setup:

Installs required libraries (torch, torchaudio, numpy).
Uses the Tacotron2 model from the torchaudio library.
Model Optimization:

Applies quantization (fbgemm) to reduce the model size and improve inference speed without significantly compromising performance.
Text Preprocessing:

Normalizes input text (e.g., converts to lowercase) as a preparation step.
Text-to-Speech Conversion:

Implements a function that processes input text and generates audio waveforms.
Uses a placeholder simulation for audio generation in the example.
Audio Playback:

Outputs the generated speech as audio using the IPython.display.Audio module.

Metrics:
Mean Opinion Score (MOS): Subjective human evaluation of audio quality.
Speech Naturalness: Measures how human-like the generated speech sounds.
Inference Latency: Assesses the time taken to convert text to speech.
