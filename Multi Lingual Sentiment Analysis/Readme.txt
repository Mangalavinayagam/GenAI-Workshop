Title:
Multi-lingual Sentiment Analysis Using Cross-lingual Models

Project Description:
This notebook implements Multilingual Sentiment Analysis using Transformer-based models. It leverages the XLM-Roberta model for sequence classification across multiple languages. The goal is to analyze text data in different languages and classify sentiments or detect hate speech, as indicated by the dataset used.

Approach:
Environment Setup:

Installs necessary libraries like transformers, datasets, and scikit-learn for NLP tasks and evaluation.
Configures system settings, such as disabling W&B integration.
Model Selection:

Utilizes the XLM-Roberta model, which is pre-trained on multilingual data, for robust cross-lingual text classification.
Data Preparation:

Loads and preprocesses a multilingual hate speech dataset (tweets_hate_speech_multilingual).
Likely involves tokenization and text-to-sequence transformations using XLMRobertaTokenizer.
Training and Evaluation:

Defines metrics for evaluation, including accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall.
Employs the Trainer class from transformers for streamlined training and evaluation.
Metrics:
The notebook explicitly defines evaluation metrics:

Accuracy: Measures the proportion of correctly classified samples.
F1 Score: Evaluates the balance between precision and recall, especially in imbalanced datasets.
Precision: Assesses the correctness of positive predictions.
Recall: Evaluates the model's ability to identify all relevant samples.
