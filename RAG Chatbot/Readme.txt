Title:
Chatbot with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Project Description:
This notebook implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot. The system combines information retrieval techniques with generative language models to answer user queries. It leverages Sentence Transformers for encoding documents into dense vector embeddings, FAISS for efficient vector similarity searches, and transformer-based generative models for crafting responses.

Approach:
Data Loading:

Reads input text data from a file (Input.txt) and stores it in a dataset.
Document Encoding:

Uses all-MiniLM-L6-v2, a lightweight Sentence Transformer model, to encode text data into embeddings.
Index Creation:

Employs FAISS to build an efficient similarity search index from the embeddings.
Document Retrieval:

Implements a retrieval function to fetch the top k documents most relevant to a given query based on vector similarity.
Generative Response:

Likely utilizes a transformer-based model (e.g., AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM) to generate natural language responses using the retrieved documents.

Metrics:
Retrieval Accuracy: Determines how often the system retrieves relevant documents.
Response Relevance: Assesses the coherence and informativeness of generated responses.
BLEU or ROUGE Scores: Evaluate the similarity of generated responses to reference answers.
