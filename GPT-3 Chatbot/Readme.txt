Title:
Text Generation with GPT-3 or GPT-4 and Fine-Tuning

Project Description:
This project integrates OpenAI's GPT-3 with additional libraries like LangChain and FAISS to build a robust natural language processing (NLP) system. It uses the OpenAI API for generating text completions and LangChain for document-based interactions, likely targeting chatbot functionality or a knowledge retrieval application.

Approach:
Environment Setup:

Installation of langchain-community and faiss-gpu for enhanced NLP and vector search capabilities.
API Interaction:

Direct calls to OpenAI's API to generate responses using the GPT-3 model (text-davinci-003).
Advanced Capabilities:

Incorporation of LangChain for creating text retrieval pipelines, embedding text (using HuggingFaceEmbeddings), and splitting text for optimized processing.

Error Handling:
Basic error management for authentication failures.

Metrics:
Response Quality: Judged by the relevance and coherence of the generated text.
Efficiency: Measured by the system's ability to process queries and return results quickly.
Scalability: Assessed by testing the model with larger datasets or complex queries.
